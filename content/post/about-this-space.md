## Welcome!

So, you've found my blog. Huzzahs are in order!

Chances are good that you were led here by me. I either directly badgered you about my awesome new blog, or you wound up here from a link I posted. If you're reading this and I didn't directly bring you here, you may be interested in learning a little more about me. Lucky for you, you can learn all you need to know [here] (/about).

I decided to start this blog to occasionally share my thoughts about programming, software development, and related topics. You always read that sharing what you've learned with other people is a good way to reinforce your own understanding of the topic, so the aim is to put this idea to the test. I keep myself pretty busy, so I don't intend to add new posts on a daily basis, but I'll make an effort to write one or two posts a week. There you have it, something you can hold me to!

This site is built on [Hugo] (http://gohugo.io), a super-rad static site generator written in [Go] (http://golang.org). It's like [Jekyll] (https://jekyllrb.com/), but actually good, because it's not written in [Ruby] (https://www.ruby-lang.org). Petty bickering aside, static sites tickle my fancy as a developer for a number of reasons:

- No server side processing! I manage servers and databases in my professional life, I really don't feel like doing it for my personal projects if I can avoid it.
- Cheaper hosting (in theory). Rather than paying for an EC2 instance to host my site, I can upload directly to AWS S3 and serve directly from there, paying only for the bytes transferred. Hugo sites can even be deployed to Github pages.
- My content gets tracked in version control right along my templates, styles, and javascript. This provides an easy way to review the history of my content in a manner in which I'm familiar.
- I get to write in my code editor rather than some flimsy browser-based editor.

Static sites certainly aren't for everyone, but if you're looking for something different than your typical Wordpress fare, then I recommend you at least give it a whirl!

I've skated around blogging for the past few years, but I'm finally deciding in 2016 to make a real go at it. I'm hesitant to call it a resolution (we all know how those go), but it's just a small piece of new things I'm trying this year to be a better me. So, if you like what you've read so far, stick around and read some of my other posts. If you want to shout words my way, [twitter] (http://twitter.com/thejettdurham) is probably the best way. If you feel strongly inclined, you could also shoot me an [email] (/contact).

[Hold on] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W6as8oVcuM), folks. 2016 is only getting started!
