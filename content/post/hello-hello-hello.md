## Hello, Hello, Hello...

Is there anybody in there?

...<<crickets chirping>>...

Okay, so I totally dropped the ball, right? I was aiming for new posts one or two times a week this year, and here we are now. Over half the year has passed, and nada. What gives?

Well, a number of things. Turns out that I'm not super great about finding things to write about. I don't have much going in terms of side projects, and work stuff is touchy to write about given the NDAs and such.

Then, as it happens, life gets busy. Work getting crazy, wife and I moved earlier in the year, two family members unexpectedly died within a month of each other. While I'm not working a crazy schedule or anything, the combined weight of it all has been taking its toll and not leaving me with much cognitive headroom to think about blogging, or any creative outlets, really. I haven't recorded any music at all this year.

However, hope yet remains. I've finally realized that some things I had taken as fixtures in my life are indeed open for change, so I'm working those avenues right now. The wife has some promising leads to finally getting back in the work force. I'm getting myself back into the local developer community. Slowly but surely, things are going to get better. Beginning to write more actively is a small piece of that puzzle, and may as well use the platform I worked "oh-so-hard" to build!

(pause for laughter)

I have some ideas on what I can write about here. I even have a "Blog" project on my Todoist to gather my thoughts, so that should help, right? In seriousness though, I've found that keeping a todo list is a critical component of trying to bring some order to the chaos that is my mind and its ideas.

What I'm trying to say is, I expect this place to become a little more active over the next few weeks. If you stick around, maybe you'll find something you want to read about?
