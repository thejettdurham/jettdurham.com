Hello! My name is Jett Durham, and I'm a professional software developer from Wichita, KS. I've worked in the software industry since 2013 and have enjoyed the luxury of working across many different domains. I have a shallow-yet-broad level of experience in almost every technology needed to deliver and operate web-based software, but these days I specialize in Frontend Web Development.

I share my life with my lovely wife, Amanda, and our three dogs: Gidget, Wheatley, and Atlas.
    
I have a wide array of other non-programming interests. I've been a musician most of my life and currently share lead guitar duties in Wichita's premier classic metal tribute band, [Gods of Wrath](https://godsofwrath.com). I grew up loving video games (I guess what you would consider _retro_ games these days), and I have a passing interest in audio and video production. I have a dream of one day bringing all of these passions together with my programming skills to develop a video game of some sort, but I have no immediate plans for actually doing that.

I love writing code and building products for a living and have no intention of stopping soon. I started this blog because I've accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience in my short-yet-dense career, and I think it's high time I take some time to share what I've learned. To you, the reader, I hope you feel inspired by my journey to keep progressing in your career, that something I write here can help you with an immediate problem you're facing in your daily work or all of the above!
