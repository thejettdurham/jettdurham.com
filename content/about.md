## About Me

Welcome to meeting me! So, my name is Jett Durham.  As Forrest Gump said, I guess that's about all I have to say about that.

Okay, so I guess there's a little bit more. Here's the thing though...I've already written my life story on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and so on. So, rather than copy-pasta the whole thing over here and have yet another story deployment to maintain by hand, how about I just provide a few handy-dandy links so you can go read more about me there? Sound good? Good!
